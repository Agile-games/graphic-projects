# Purpose
This repository will contain all the basic graphic projects that will be used to learn the threejs module in Javascript

# How to run/test the project
Make sure you are in the "cgv_lab9" directory before running the commands below
# Step 1
    Type "npm -i" on your terminal to install the required modules
# Step 2
    Type "npm run dev" and you should see your code editor re-routing you to a website

# What you will see and what the scene does for now

    At first glance the scene is underwhelming, A black canvas and four black geometries.
    This is a bug I'm still working on fixing, hopefully it'll all be sorted sometime today. When you click on Animate you'll see textures loaded in and you can move around the camera by hovering your mouse over the canvas and using the Keys W and S to move forward and back respectively with respect to the z-axis to see the effect of the lighting used on these different textures(And this is the intended behaviour as opposed to what you had witnessed at first). 

# Collaboration

    You are welcome to play around with the concepts we've learned about in class since this is just a practice projects/repo, if you want to test out something first before 
    implementing it on our real project you are welcome to test things out in this repository. Lets have some fun and learn alot while at it :)
