# Purpose
This repository will contain all the basic graphic projects that will be used to learn the threejs module in Javascript

# How to run/test the project(cgv_lab9)
Make sure you are in a specific project directory before running the commands below
# Step 1
    Type "npm -i" on your terminal to install the required modules
# Step 2
    Type "npm run dev" and you should see your code editor re-routing you to a website

# What you will see and what the scene does for now
    This is a very basic scene with four geometries each with different textured materials rotating
    about the y-axis. This program is for testing different lighting on different texture 
    materials. You are also free to move around the camera using the controls shown on the upper 
    right side of the screen or using your mouse. We will extend more around this practice project 
    in order to test stuff out befeore actually implement them in our actual project. We shall play
    around with this scene, extend on it, add more interesting and complex objects, maps, characters 
    and try out more debugging tools.

# Collaboration
    You are welcome to play around with the concepts we've learned about in class since this is just
    a practice projects/repo, if you want to test out something first before implementing it on our
    real project you are welcome to test things out in this repository.
    Lets have some fun and learn alot while at it :)
